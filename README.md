# AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp Repo

This is my repo for my projects for the *free* AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp course, hosted by DataTalks.Club and taught by Alexey Grigorev. The course launched on November 18, 2025.  More information can be found at https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp.

## Module 1 — Introduction to Vibe Coding / AI Tools Overview
### Introduction to Vibe Coding (Workshop)
The first module of the course provides an introduction to AI coding tools through the creation of simple project demos.  During the Introduction to Vibe Coding Workshop, we learned how to use AI coding tools to create the classic "snake" game.  

### Homework assignment:  Create a to-do app using Django and the AI coding tool of your choice
I used Claude Code's CLI to create the app.  The code for my project can be found in the TODO directory of Module 1.

## Module 2 — End-to-End Application (Snake Game)
For this module, we are learning how to create an end-to-end application using AI tools--creating the frontend, extracting OpenAI specs from the frontend, implementing the backend using FastAPI, adding database support to the backend, containerizing the works, deploying to Render, and creating a CI/CD pipeline for deployment.
