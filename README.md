# AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp Repo

This is my repo for my projects for the *free* AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp course, hosted by DataTalks.Club and taught by Alexey Grigorev. The course launched on November 18, 2025.  More information can be found at https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp.

## Module 1--Introduction to Vibe Coding / AI Tools Overview
### Introduction to Vibe Coding (Workshop)
The first module of the course provides an introduction to AI coding tools through the creation of simple project demos.  During the Introduction to Vibe Coding Workshop, we learned how to use AI coding tools to create the classic "snake" game.  

I created this game in three different tools:  ChatGPT, Claude Code (CLI version), and Lovable.  Claude Code won the bake-off against ChatGPT: it was 100% functional right out of the box, and looked better, too.  Lovable was the easiest to implement, however, and had the nicest appearance of the three.

My repo for the workshop: https://github.com/gdurante2019/AI-Dev-Tools-Intro-Vibe-Coding.  
The DataTalksClub workshop repo: https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp/tree/main/01-overview. 

### First project:  Create a to-do app using Django and the AI coding tool of your choice
I used Claude Code's CLI to create the app, following the homework instructions at https://github.com/DataTalksClub/ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2025/01-overview/homework.md.  The code for my project can be found in the TODO directory of this repo.

## Module 2
Module 2 has just launched.  Stay tuned...
